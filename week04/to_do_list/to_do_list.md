# To-Do List App with Recurring Reminders for Individuals with ADHD

## Overview

This To-Do List app is designed to help individuals stay organized and focused on their most important tasks, particularly those with ADHD who may find it challenging to manage time and prioritize tasks. The app includes a special feature that reminds users to complete the top 3 tasks on their to-do list every 2 hours until they are marked as done.

Although it might be annoying, I want the 2-hour interval reminders to be a feature that cannot be turned off. The purpose of this To-Do List app is to constantly remind the users to get the tasks done until it is marked as completed.

## Extra Features

### 1. **Top 3 Unfinished Tasks**
The app will identify and focus on the top 3 tasks that have not been completed. These top 3 tasks are based on the order in which they were added to the list.

### 2. **Recurring Reminders Every 2 Hours**
To assist users with ADHD who may struggle with task completion and time management, the app includes an automated reminder system that prompts the user to complete their top 3 tasks every 2 hours.

### 3. **Specialized Messages**
The app will have a fun specialized message when sending out reminders to users to motivate the users to complete the tasks. These messages are meant to illicit a sense of urgency, guilt, or dread. Example messages are:
1. "Tick-tock! Time’s slipping away, and your tasks aren’t done yet! Get moving!"
2. "Remember that task you said you’d do? It’s still waiting… 😬"
3. "Procrastination called—it’s wondering if you’re still friends. But your to-do list? It’s begging for attention!"
4. "The clock is ticking... your tasks aren’t gonna finish themselves!"
5. "Imagine how good it’ll feel when this is finally done… Or just keep dreading it!"
6. "Hey! You’ve been scrolling long enough—time to tackle that to-do list!"
7. "Your future self is either celebrating or panicking—what’s it gonna be?"
8. "I see you’ve been avoiding this task. Guess what? It’s still here. 😏"
9. "Your to-do list is silently judging you right now… better fix that!"
10. "Your to-do list is starting to feel neglected. Maybe show it some love?"

## Benefits

### 1. **Clear Prioritization**
Limiting the reminder to the top 3 tasks reduces the feeling of overwhelm that can come from a long, unmanageable to-do list. Users can concentrate on just a few tasks at a time, making task completion more achievable.
### 2. **Increased Accountability**
Regular reminders encourage users to keep their tasks on top of their mind, especially when they are prone to distractions or forgetting about them.

## User Flow

### 1. **Add Tasks**
The user adds multiple tasks to the list, which could include daily responsibilities, work-related tasks, or personal goals.

### 2. **Top 3 Tasks Identified**
The app automatically highlights and keeps track of the top 3 unfinished tasks.

### 3. **Receive Reminders**
Every 2 hours, the app sends a reminder to complete these top 3 tasks.

### 4. **Mark Tasks as Done**
As tasks are completed, they are marked as done and removed from the list of reminders. The next priority tasks are moved up into the top 3.

### 5. **Reminders Continue**
